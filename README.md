# Strategy

The benchmark is the Nasdaq 100. We aim to maximize a balance between the minimum portfolio value and its expected return. On average, the strategy (cost-adjusted) outperforms the benchmark, and the maximum drawdown is significantly reduced, even during crises. The results are robust to different time horizon, different parameters.
